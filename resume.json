I have been programming for over four years, over which I have picked up a variety of languages and skills. Currently, I work as a software developer for Provender, focusing on front end applications while occasionally contributing to the main Ruby on Rails application. Outside of work I frequently spend time on a wide range of personal projects (programming and otherwise), as well as participate in local hackathons. ",

Players' perspectives are behind their paddle, which can move along both the X and Y axis. Players control their paddles with their webcam, as the project uses OpenCV to track objects that the in game paddle follows. (For demonstration at Blueprint we used a bright blue glove)"

The game can be played by two players on separate machines, and others who join the game are able to spectate the match in progress."

We would try to organize a group event, but the Facebook chat used for that purpose would quickly get off track and out of hand, so for LexHack we made a webapp that focused just on the place and time of events, and allowed people to RSVP to the event and track those on their way through Google Maps."
