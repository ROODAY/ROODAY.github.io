ROODAY's Glorious Website
================

The internet page of true glory   

This github repository that your eyes are laying themselves upon are the home of the files that make up my glorious website. As of now, it's not that glorious, but don't worry, it'll get there. The site currently is only a skeleton and I plan on finishing all the designs and aspects of the site before I add in any content. 

Plans for the Site
===============

* Add in a nice system of parallax backgrounds and elements using the scrollmagic.js plugin for jQuery.   
* Create an easy to use CMS for updating a blog portion of the site.   
* Register domain names for the site and its parts.   
* Have the site tell a story through scrolling.   
* Make sure to keep it clean.   
* Add in stylesheet options at the top in a menu and use php to save their session and remember on reloads for a certain period of time (3 hours sounds good)
* Have one of the options try and draw colors from their browser called auto. 
* Add inn drop down menus in the navbar. 
* finish this list of things to finish
