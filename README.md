ROODAY.com
================

Rudhra Raveendran's (ROODAY) website. Relies on too many frameworks at the moment (material bootstrap, polymer, bourbon). In the future, remove reliance on polymer and bourbon, as that will greatly decrease size of the site.

Eventually move this site to a Digital Ocean server, and get a Google Apps email. Set up Cloudflare to work with that email.
